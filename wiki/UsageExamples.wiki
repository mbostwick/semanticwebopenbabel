= Introduction =

You should be able to use the OWL/RDF plugin just like any other Open Babel plugin (the only limitation is that it's a write-only plugin at the moment).


= Usage =

The general usage is:
<ob_executable> -i<input_format> <input_file> -oowl <owl_file> -q<config_file> 

-q argument is optional, if it's skipped, configuration will be read from `OwlPluginConfiguration.xml` file, which should be located in the same directory as the Open Babel executable.

== Examples ==

Here we assume that 'babel' is the name of our Open Babel executable.


  # Read `CID_1549520.sdf`, write to `CID_1549520.owl`, use `owl_conf2.xml` as config: 
  _babel -isdf `CID_1549520.sdf` -oowl `CID_1549520.owl` -q”`owl_conf2.xml`”_ 
  
  # Read `CID_1549520.sdf`, write to `CID_1549520.owl`, use `OwlPluginConfiguration.xml` as config:
  _babel -isdf `CID_1549520.sdf` -oowl `CID_1549520.owl`_ 

  # Read `CID_1549520.sdf` and output resulting owl file to console.
  _babel -isdf `CID_1549520.sdf` -oowl_
